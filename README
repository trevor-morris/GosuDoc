Not much to say yet. Start of a tool for generating JavaDoc like output for Gosu

ORGANIZATION

Three modules:
- core: core interfaces and types
- itype: implementations of core interfaces and types based on Gosu ITypes
- html: HTML generation based on core interfaces and types

One possibly confusing bit of design; in the html module all the core types are enhanced with companion objects via a Html property. For example if docSet is an IGosuDocSet (core object) then docSet.Html will return the companion object for a doc set, which provides methods for generating Html.

RUNNING GOSUDOC

There's a Main.gsp:

Main -sources <sourcedirs> -packages <packages> -output <outputdir>

Source directories and packages are comma separated.

Lots still to do - see the ToDo.txt file
