Not much to say yet. Start of a tool for generating JavaDoc like output for Gosu

ORGANIZATION

Three modules:
- core: core interfaces and types
- itype: implementations of core interfaces and types based on Gosu ITypes
- html: HTML generation based on core interfaces and types

There's a rudimentary Main.gsp, currently just for testing

One possibly confusing bit of design; in the html module all the core types are enhanced with companion objects via
a Html property. For example if docSet is an IGosuDocSet (core object) then docSet.Html will return the companion
object for a doc set, which provides methods for generating Html.

Lots still to do - see the ToDo.txt file
