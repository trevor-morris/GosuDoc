Core GosuDoc interfaces and types. Building GosuDoc for a set of types has two parts; first the types are transformed
into the core interfaces and types in this package. Then the GosuDoc is generated from the core interfaces and types.
This allows the HTML (or other) document generation to be separated from the type processing.
